When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when working with other people, when working from various machines, to keep work backed up

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- you might be working on a future branch, an experimental feature or refactoring of code
